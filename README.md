#  My First Memory Game

This is my second Milestone Project where I show what I've learned to build an Interactive Web Application.

I've decided to use one of the options for the Milestone Project The Code Institute has suggested as a memory
game is always fun and keeps the user intertained for a good while.

## Demo

A live demo can be accessed at  https://suzanaferreira.github.io/memory-game-project/ 

## UX

The goal of this memory game is to provide the player to have good fun with a simple but colourful and cheerful aspect. 
It consists of the player having to click at two cards from the board and check if they match, if they do, the cards remain flipped, 
otherwise the cards return to the initial position.

The game ends when all the cards on the board have matched.

The game has a timer and a counter of the attempts until it finds a match which motivates the player to match all the cards as fast as possible 
and as few as possible attempts.

When the game ends it shows the results and it's possible the player to play again and again. (I've done it myself which made the building of this game even more fun and
enjoyable).

The game has also sound effects whether the player matchs or not which makes the experience of playing more exciting.

Every time the game restarts, the cards are shuffled and positioned at different places.

To play again, the player needs to click on the play again button followed by closing the box.

## Credits
I consulted these websites to have an idea on how to grasp a few features on my game:
  -https://scotch.io,
  -https://codepen.io,  
  -https://taniarascia.com,

I also consulted uncountable videos on youtube to grasp JavaScript, chanels such as:
  -freeCodeCamp.org
  -Adam khoury

Not to mention my Mentor Owonikoko, Tutor Support and all my colleagues from Code Institute the support through slack.
